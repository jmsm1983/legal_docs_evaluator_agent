Predefined Criteria for Acceptability
1. Parties and Purpose
Criteria: The NDA should clearly state the identities of the parties involved, their legal entities, business addresses, and the purpose for sharing confidential information.
Acceptability Standard:
Full legal names and designations (e.g., "Disclosing Party" and "Receiving Party") should be used.
The purpose of information sharing should be specific, limited, and directly related to the disclosed information (e.g., evaluating a potential acquisition).
Any reference to affiliates, subsidiaries, or related parties should be clearly defined.
2. Definition of Confidential Information
Criteria: The NDA should explicitly define "Confidential Information," covering business, technical, financial, and other proprietary data.
Acceptability Standard:
Confidential Information should include categories such as financial information, business plans, product details, client lists, trade secrets, and technical specifications.
The NDA should clarify that the absence of a "Confidential" label does not preclude information from being treated as confidential.
Ensure that both written and verbal disclosures are covered, as well as observations and derivations made by the Receiving Party based on Confidential Information.
3. Use of Confidential Information
Criteria: The NDA should restrict the Receiving Party’s use of Confidential Information solely to the stated purpose.
Acceptability Standard:
Confidential Information should be explicitly limited to the specified purpose (e.g., due diligence for acquisition).
The NDA should prohibit the Receiving Party from using Confidential Information to gain a competitive advantage, even indirectly.
Specific language should prevent the use of Confidential Information for any purpose beyond the scope of the agreement unless authorized in writing by the Disclosing Party.
4. Non-Disclosure Obligations
Criteria: The NDA should strictly prohibit unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information.
Acceptability Standard:
Unauthorized distribution, disclosure, or dissemination to third parties should be prohibited.
Confidential Information should only be shared with third parties on a "need-to-know" basis, and those third parties must be bound by confidentiality obligations.
The Receiving Party should exercise at least the same level of care to protect Confidential Information as it does for its own sensitive information, ideally with a minimum standard specified.
5. Ownership and Return of Information
Criteria: The NDA should confirm that Confidential Information remains the property of the Disclosing Party and should provide for its return or destruction.
Acceptability Standard:
The NDA should clearly state that all rights to Confidential Information remain with the Disclosing Party.
Upon termination of the agreement or upon request, the Receiving Party should be obligated to return or destroy all copies of Confidential Information.
Any derived materials or copies should be included, and destruction should be verifiable (e.g., written confirmation of destruction).
6. Exceptions to Confidentiality Obligations
Criteria: Specific exceptions should be defined when Confidential Information is not protected under the agreement.
Acceptability Standard:
Standard exceptions include:
Information in the public domain (provided it didn’t enter due to a breach).
Information already known by the Receiving Party legally before disclosure.
Information independently developed by the Receiving Party without using Confidential Information.
Partial public knowledge should not render the entire set of information non-confidential.
7. Duration of Confidentiality Obligations
Criteria: The NDA should specify the duration of confidentiality obligations.
Acceptability Standard:
The NDA should specify a clear timeframe for confidentiality (e.g., 3-5 years) to ensure reasonable enforceability.
If trade secrets are involved, the NDA may specify perpetual confidentiality obligations, with a note about the distinction from standard confidential information.
8. Right to Refuse Disclosure
Criteria: The Disclosing Party should retain the right to decide which information to disclose.
Acceptability Standard:
The NDA should not obligate the Disclosing Party to disclose any particular type of information, giving it full discretion over what is shared.
9. Legal Capacity and Authority
Criteria: Both parties should warrant their authority to enter into the agreement.
Acceptability Standard:
Both the Disclosing Party and Receiving Party should warrant that they have the legal authority and capacity to execute the obligations set forth in the NDA.
The NDA should state that the individual signing on behalf of each party has the authority to bind the party to the agreement.
10. Entire Agreement and Amendments
Criteria: The NDA should constitute the entire agreement and require written consent for any amendments.
Acceptability Standard:
The NDA should clearly state that it supersedes all prior understandings regarding confidentiality.
Any amendments must be made in writing and signed by both parties.
11. Jurisdiction and Governing Law
Criteria: Specify the governing law for the agreement.
Acceptability Standard:
The NDA should include a governing law clause, preferably in a jurisdiction favorable to the Disclosing Party.
For international agreements, specify which country's laws will apply and, if possible, address dispute resolution mechanisms.
12. Confidentiality of the Agreement’s Existence
Criteria: The NDA should require the Receiving Party to keep the existence of the NDA confidential.
Acceptability Standard:
The NDA should require confidentiality around the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place, especially if sensitive business dealings are involved.
13. Legal Disclosure and Protective Orders
Criteria: The NDA should provide a process for legally compelled disclosure.
Acceptability Standard:
The Receiving Party should notify the Disclosing Party if compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information, allowing time to seek protective orders.
Only the minimum legally required disclosure should be permitted if a protective order is unavailable.
14. Remedies for Breach
Criteria: The NDA should outline remedies in case of confidentiality breaches.
Acceptability Standard:
The NDA should specify that monetary damages may be insufficient, and the Disclosing Party may seek injunctive relief or specific performance.
Consequences for breach should be outlined to ensure enforceability and provide adequate recourse.
15. No Waiver Clause
Criteria: The NDA should specify that failure to enforce any provision does not constitute a waiver.
Acceptability Standard:
Include a clause clarifying that delay or failure to enforce rights does not waive future enforcement of those rights.
16. Assignment Restriction
Criteria: Prevent the Receiving Party from assigning or transferring the NDA without consent.
Acceptability Standard:
The Receiving Party should not be allowed to assign the NDA or transfer Confidential Information without the Disclosing Party’s written consent.
17. Notice Requirement for Unauthorized Disclosures
Criteria: The NDA should require notification in case of unauthorized disclosure.
Acceptability Standard:
The Receiving Party must notify the Disclosing Party immediately upon discovering any unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information.
18. Data Security Measures
Criteria: The NDA should require reasonable data security measures.
Acceptability Standard:
Specify that the Receiving Party must implement reasonable security practices to protect Confidential Information from unauthorized access, theft, or leaks.
19. Audit Rights (Optional)
Criteria: Allow the Disclosing Party to audit the Receiving Party’s compliance with confidentiality obligations.
Acceptability Standard:
In highly sensitive agreements, the NDA may allow for periodic audits to ensure compliance with confidentiality measures.
