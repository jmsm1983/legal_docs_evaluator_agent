The Arbitrator shall, upon the request of either Party, issue a written opinion of the findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall deliver a copy to each of the Parties.  Each Party shall bear its own costs and attorneys' fees, and the Parties shall equally bear the fees, costs, and expenses of the Arbitrator and the arbitration proceedings; provided, however, that the Arbitrator may exercise discretion to award costs, including reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees, to the prevailing Party.
