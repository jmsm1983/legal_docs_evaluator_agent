An agent to evaluate legal documents

Legal Doc Evaluator Agent is an AI-driven tool designed to streamline the review, analysis, and compliance-checking of legal documents. It leverages advanced reflection techniques to autonomously evaluate and improve its responses, making it an ideal solution for repetitive, detail-oriented tasks in the legal domain. By automatically analyzing contracts, NDAs, Codes of Conduct, and Asset Transfer Agreements among others, this agent can identify high-risk clauses, suggest modifications, and ensure documents align with company standards—all without requiring extensive manual review.

Key Features
1. Automated Document Analysis: Evaluates legal documents, such as contracts, NDAs, and codes of conduct, for compliance with pre-set guidelines and policies.
Supports comparison of uploaded documents with “acceptability clauses” or policy standards to verify alignment with organizational requirements.
2. Risk Assessment of Clauses:  Assigns risk ratings (from 1 to 10) to individual clauses, helping users focus on potentially problematic sections.
Provides a clear overview of high-risk areas within a document, allowing quick identification of clauses that may need negotiation or adjustment.
3. Reflective Learning for Continuous Improvement:  Incorporates a feedback loop between Actor and Revisor roles, enabling self-assessment and iterative refinement of responses.
Utilizes external data sources and APIs (e.g., web search, legal databases) to enrich the evaluation process with up-to-date information.

How It Works: 

When a question is submitted, the tool first determines its nature. For legal questions, it searches a vector database for relevant legal documents, including newly uploaded files. If the query isn’t legal, the tool shifts to a web search to gather the most appropriate information. Once documents are retrieved, it classifies any uploaded file by type, which fine-tunes additional web searches if more information is necessary.

After locating relevant documents, the tool assesses each one for its relevance to the specific question, retaining only those that add significant value. With a solid base of relevant information, the tool generates a response derived from these documents. If the available documents don’t fully answer the question, the tool broadens its search online to enhance the response.

In the final step, the tool verifies the response for both accuracy and usefulness. Once validated, the answer is delivered to the user. This seamless combination of document retrieval, classification, and online research makes the tool a dependable and efficient resource for delivering precise, prompt answers to legal queries.
